    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <h3>by re|solution CEO Johnny Mcrealname</h3>
    <p>Growing up out in New Ancient Pillsbirge I often found myself staring at different sizes of canisters, wondering “Can I fit the ashes of a human being in this?” No, those weren’t the creeping thoughts of a child serial killer, those were the thoughts of an ambitious visionary, who at the bright young age of 42 would achieve his lifelong dream of bringing people together through the dust of dead folks. We here at re|solution are guided by one prinicable: community. Our core belief is that, just as every dog has its day, every corpse has its urn. Guided by this belief, we have tied people together with this communal effort of sharing canisters with the express purpose of storing and transporting the physical bodies of our ancestors. Our “100%” legitimate business model has bred innovations such as the Urnulele, a fully functioning ukulele with the double purpose of storing human remains, and the Pokeurn for the gamer we all know, now in family size! These modernizations have revitalized the industry, and undercut the malicious funeral monopoly. We are proud of all our independent creators and proud of all of you.
